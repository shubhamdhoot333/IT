A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.

There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).

1.Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
2.After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.
3.JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.



*local variable

<script>  
function abc(){  
var x=10;//local variable  
}  
</script>  


*global variable

A JavaScript global variable is accessible from any function. A variable i.e. declared outside the function or declared with window object is known as global variable. 
For example:

<script>  
var data=200;//gloabal variable  
function a(){  
document.writeln(data);  
}  
function b(){  
document.writeln(data);  
}  
a();//calling JavaScript function  
b();  
</script>  




Javascript Data Types
JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript.

Primitive data type
Non-primitive (reference) data type


String	------represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"
Number	------	represents numeric values e.g. 100
Boolean	-----represents boolean value either false or true
Undefined-----	represents undefined value
Null   --------	represents null i.e. no value at all

JavaScript non-primitive data types

Object---	represents instance through which we can access members
Array----	represents group of similar values
RegExp---	represents regular expression

example

var a=40;//holding number  
var b="Rahul";//holding string
