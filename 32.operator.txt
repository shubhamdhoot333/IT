JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands.

There are following types of operators in JavaScript.

1.Arithmetic Operators
2.Comparison (Relational) Operators
3.Bitwise Operators
4.Logical Operators
5.Assignment Operators
6.Special Operators

1.Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on the operands.
+	Addition	10+20 = 30
-	Subtraction	20-10 = 10
*	Multiplication	10*20 = 200
/	Division	20/10 = 2
%	Modulus (Remainder)	20%10 = 0
++	Increment	var a=10; a++; Now a = 11
--	Decrement	var a=10; a--; Now a = 9


2.JavaScript Comparison Operators

==	Is equal to	10==20 = false
===	Identical (equal and of same type)	10==20 = false
!=	Not equal to	10!=20 = true
!==	Not Identical	20!==20 = false
>	Greater than	20>10 = true
>=	Greater than or equal to	20>=10 = true
<	Less than	20<10 = false
<=	Less than or equal to	20<=10 = false

3.JavaScript Bitwise Operators

&	Bitwise AND	(10==20 & 20==33) = false
|	Bitwise OR	(10==20 | 20==33) = false
^	Bitwise XOR	(10==20 ^ 20==33) = false
~	Bitwise NOT	(~10) = -10
<<	Bitwise Left Shift	(10<<2) = 40
>>	Bitwise Right Shift	(10>>2) = 2
>>>	Bitwise Right Shift with Zero	(10>>>2) = 2

4.JavaScript Logical Operators

&&	Logical AND	(10==20 && 20==33) = false
||	Logical OR	(10==20 || 20==33) = false
!	Logical Not	!(10==20) = true

5.JavaScript Assignment Operators

=	Assign	10+10 = 20
+=	Add and assign	var a=10; a+=20; Now a = 30
-=	Subtract and assign	var a=20; a-=10; Now a = 10
*=	Multiply and assign	var a=10; a*=20; Now a = 200
/=	Divide and assign	var a=10; a/=2; Now a = 5
%=	Modulus and assign	var a=10; a%=2; Now a = 0

6.JavaScript Special Operators

(?:)	-Conditional Operator returns value based on the condition. It is like if-else.
,	-Comma Operator allows multiple expressions to be evaluated as single statement.
delete	-Delete Operator deletes a property from the object.
in	-In Operator checks if object has the given property
instanceof  -	checks if the object is an instance of given type
new	-creates an instance (object)
typeof	-checks the type of object.
void	-it discards the expression's return value.
yield	-checks what is returned in a generator by the generator's iterator.
