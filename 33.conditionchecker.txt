JavaScript If-else
The JavaScript if-else statement is used to execute the code whether condition is true or false. There are three forms of if statement in JavaScript.

1.If Statement
2.If else statement
3.if else if statement


JavaScript If statement

syntax--
if(expression){  
//content to be evaluated  
}  

example

<script>  
var a=20;  
if(a>10){  
document.write("value of a is greater than 10");  
}  
</script>  



JavaScript If...else Statement

if(expression){  
//content to be evaluated if condition is true  
}  
else{  
//content to be evaluated if condition is false  
}  


JavaScript If...else if statement

syntax
if(expression1){  
//content to be evaluated if expression1 is true  
}  
else if(expression2){  
//content to be evaluated if expression2 is true  
}  
else if(expression3){  
//content to be evaluated if expression3 is true  
}  
else{  
//content to be evaluated if no expression is true  
}  



switch


The JavaScript switch statement is used to execute one code from multiple expressions. It is just like else if statement that we have learned in previous page.
 But it is convenient than if..else..if because it can be used with numbers, characters etc.

switch(expression){  
case value1:  
 code to be executed;  
 break;  
case value2:  
 code to be executed;  
 break;  
......  
  
default:   
 code to be executed if above values are not matched;  
}  



loop 

1.for 

The JavaScript for loop iterates the elements for the fixed number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is known. 
The syntax of for loop is given below.

for (initialization; condition; increment)  
{  
    code to be executed  
}  


2.while
while (condition)  
{  
    code to be executed  
}  

3.do-while  loop

do{  
    code to be executed  
}while (condition);
