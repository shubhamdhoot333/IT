jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

The jQuery library contains the following features:

HTML/DOM manipulation
CSS manipulation
HTML event methods
Effects and animations
AJAX
Utilities



Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages
There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:

Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google



The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with the HTML <script> tag (notice that the <script> tag should be inside the <head> section):

<head>
<script src="jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
</head>


jQuery CDN
If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

Google is an example of someone who host jQuery:

Google CDN:
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>


With jQuery you select (query) HTML elements and perform "actions" on them.

jQuery Syntax
The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s).

Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()

A $ sign to define/access jQuery
A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)

$(this).hide() - hides the current element.

$("p").hide() - hides all <p> elements.

$(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class="test".

$("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test".


jQuery Selectors
jQuery selectors allow you to select and manipulate HTML element(s).

jQuery selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their name, id, classes, types, attributes, values of attributes and much more. It's based on the existing CSS Selectors, and in addition, it has some own custom selectors.

All selectors in jQuery start with the dollar sign and parentheses: $().


1.The element Selector
The jQuery element selector selects elements based on the element name.

You can select all <p> elements on a page like this:

$("p")

2.The #id Selector
The jQuery #id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML tag to find the specific element.

An id should be unique within a page, so you should use the #id selector when you want to find a single, unique element.

To find an element with a specific id, write a hash character, followed by the id of the HTML element:

$("#test")

3.The .class Selector
The jQuery .class selector finds elements with a specific class.

To find elements with a specific class, write a period character, followed by the name of the class:

$(".test")

What are Events?
All the different visitors' actions that a web page can respond to are called events.

An event represents the precise moment when something happens.

Examples:

moving a mouse over an element
selecting a radio button
clicking on an element
The term "fires/fired" is often used with events. Example: "The keypress event is fired, the moment you press a key".

Here are some common DOM events:


click	       keypress	  submit    load
dblclick       keydown	  change    resize
mouseenter     keyup	  focus	    scroll
mouseleave	 	  blur	    unload
