AJAX is not a programming language.
AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers from a web page.
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.


AJAX just uses a combination of:

A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)


AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. 
This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page

1. An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript
3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server
4. The server processes the request
5. The server sends a response back to the web page
6. The response is read by JavaScript
7. Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript




The XMLHttpRequest Object
All modern browsers support the XMLHttpRequest object.

The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to exchange data with a server behind the scenes. 
This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.


The XMLHttpRequest object is used to exchange data with a server.

Send a Request To a Server
To send a request to a server, we use the open() and send() methods of the XMLHttpRequest object:

xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", true);
xhttp.send();

get method 
xhttp.open("GET", "demo_get.asp", true);
xhttp.send();

post method
xhttp.open("POST", "demo_post.asp", true);
xhttp.send();
